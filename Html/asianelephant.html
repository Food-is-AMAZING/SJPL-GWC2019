    <h3><u>Asian Elephant</u></h3>
    <p8><img src= "Elephas_maximus_(Bandipur).jpg" ALIGN="right" width= "300" height= "200">
    The IUCN’s best guess on the current population of Asian elephants,
    which inhabits 13 countries, is around 40,000–50,000. That number may be
    far lower; some regions inhabited by the lumbering pachyderms are 
    inaccessible due to the terrain or to political volatility. Over 50% of
    the population is concentrated in India. The burgeoning human population
    there—and elsewhere in Asia—creates conflicts for space and resources.
    And while the tusks of Asian elephants are much smaller than those of 
    their African counterparts, the Asian species is still poached for its 
    ivory, meat, and skin.</p8>
